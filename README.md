# TTB-2D

This repository is folked from [TTB-2D](https://github.com/DanielCanteroNTNU/TTB-2D).

The goal is to provide additional scripts to generate datasets considering the variable train load, the variable train speed as well as the influence of the temperature on the beam stiffness.

We try to reproduce the same dataset setting from [Probabilistic autoencoder-based bridge damage assessment using train-induced responses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327023009548) by Muhammad Zohaib Sarwar, Daniel Cantero.
